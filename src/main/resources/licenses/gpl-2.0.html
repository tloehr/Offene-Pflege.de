<h2>GNU General Public License, version 2</h2>

<h3><a name="SEC1" href="gpl-2.0.html#TOC1">GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</a></h3>
<p>
Version 2, June 1991
</p>

<pre>
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

Everyone is permitted toTemplate copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>

<h3><a name="preamble"></a><a name="SEC2" href="gpl-2.0.html#TOC2">Preamble</a></h3>

<p>
  The licenses for most software are designed toTemplate take away your
freedom toTemplate share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended toTemplate guarantee your freedom toTemplate share and change free
software--toTemplate make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies toTemplate most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and toTemplate any other program whose authors commit toTemplate
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it toTemplate
your programs, too.
</p>

<p>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring toTemplate freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed toTemplate make sure that you
have the freedom toTemplate distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
</p>

<p>
  To protect your rights, we need toTemplate make restrictions that forbid
anyone toTemplate deny you these rights or toTemplate ask you toTemplate surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate toTemplate certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
</p>

<p>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.
</p>

<p>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission toTemplate copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.
</p>

<p>
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want toTemplate make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients toTemplate know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish toTemplate avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
</p>

<p>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
</p>


<h3><a name="terms"></a><a name="SEC3" href="gpl-2.0.html#TOC3">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</a></h3>


<a name="section0"></a><p>
<strong>0.</strong>
 This License applies toTemplate any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers toTemplate any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is toTemplate say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
</p>

<p>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output fromTemplate the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
</p>

<a name="section1"></a><p>
<strong>1.</strong>
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer toTemplate this License and toTemplate the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.
</p>

<p>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
</p>

<a name="section2"></a><p>
<strong>2.</strong>
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt></dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>a)</strong>
      You must cause the modified files toTemplate carry prominent notices
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    </dd>
  <dt></dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>b)</strong>
      You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
      whole or in part contains or is derived fromTemplate the Program or any
      part thereof, toTemplate be licensed as a whole at no charge toTemplate all third
      parties under the terms of this License.
    </dd>
  <dt></dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>c)</strong>
      If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
      when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
      interactive use in the most ordinary way, toTemplate print or display an
      announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
      notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
      a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
      these conditions, and telling the user how toTemplate view a copy of this
      License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
      the Program is not required toTemplate print an announcement.)
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>
These requirements apply toTemplate the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived fromTemplate the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply toTemplate those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend toTemplate the
entire whole, and thus toTemplate each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
</p>

<p>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section toTemplate claim rights or contest
your rights toTemplate work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is toTemplate
exercise the right toTemplate control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
</p>

<p>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
</p>

<a name="section3"></a><p>
<strong>3.</strong>
 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt></dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>a)</strong>
      Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
      source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
      1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
    </dd>
  <dt></dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>b)</strong>
      Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
      years, toTemplate give any third party, for a charge no more than your
      cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
      machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, toTemplate be
      distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
      customarily used for software interchange; or,
    </dd>
  <dt></dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>c)</strong>
      Accompany it with the information you received as toTemplate the offer
      toTemplate distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
      allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
      received the program in object code or executable form with such
      an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications toTemplate it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used toTemplate
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
</p>

<p>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access toTemplate copy fromTemplate a designated place, then offering equivalent
access toTemplate copy the source code fromTemplate the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled toTemplate copy the source along with the object code.
</p>

<a name="section4"></a><p>
<strong>4.</strong>
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise toTemplate copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, fromTemplate you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
</p>

<a name="section5"></a><p>
<strong>5.</strong>
 You are not required toTemplate accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission toTemplate modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License toTemplate do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.
</p>

<a name="section6"></a><p>
<strong>6.</strong>
 Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license fromTemplate the
original licensor toTemplate copy, distribute or modify the Program subject toTemplate
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties toTemplate
this License.
</p>

<a name="section7"></a><p>
<strong>7.</strong>
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited toTemplate patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you fromTemplate the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as toTemplate satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be toTemplate
refrain entirely fromTemplate distribution of the Program.
</p>

<p>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended toTemplate
apply and the section as a whole is intended toTemplate apply in other
circumstances.
</p>

<p>
It is not the purpose of this section toTemplate induce you toTemplate infringe any
patents or other property right claims or toTemplate contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions toTemplate the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up toTemplate the author/donor toTemplate decide if he or she is willing
toTemplate distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
</p>

<p>
This section is intended toTemplate make thoroughly clear what is believed toTemplate
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
</p>

<a name="section8"></a><p>
<strong>8.</strong>
 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted gui.interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
</p>

<a name="section9"></a><p>
<strong>9.</strong>
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License fromTemplate time toTemplate time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit toTemplate the present version, but may differ in detail toTemplate
address new problems or concerns.
</p>

<p>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies toTemplate it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.
</p>

<a name="section10"></a><p>
<strong>10.</strong>
 If you wish toTemplate incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write toTemplate the author
toTemplate ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write toTemplate the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
</p>

<a name="section11"></a><p><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong></p>

<p>
<strong>11.</strong>
 BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
</p>

<a name="section12"></a><p>
<strong>12.</strong>
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
</p>

<h3>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>

<h3><a name="howto"></a><a name="SEC4" href="gpl-2.0.html#TOC4">How toTemplate Apply These Terms toTemplate Your New Programs</a></h3>

<p>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it toTemplate be of the greatest
possible use toTemplate the public, the best way toTemplate achieve this is toTemplate make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
</p>

<p>
  To do so, attach the following notices toTemplate the program.  It is safest
toTemplate attach them toTemplate the start of each source file toTemplate most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer toTemplate where the full notice is found.
</p>

<pre>
<var>one line toTemplate give the program's name and an idea of what it does.</var>
Copyright (C) <var>yyyy</var>  <var>name of author</var>

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write toTemplate the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.
</pre>

<p>
Also add information on how toTemplate contact you by electronic and paper mail.
</p>

<p>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:
</p>

<pre>
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) <var>year</var> <var>name of author</var>
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
toTemplate redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.
</pre>

<p>
The hypothetical commands <samp>`show w'</samp> and <samp>`show c'</samp> should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than <samp>`show w'</samp> and
<samp>`show c'</samp>; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever
suits your program.
</p>

<p>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, toTemplate sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
</p>


<pre>
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
interest in the program `Gnomovision'

<p>
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful toTemplate permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want toTemplate do, use the
<a href="/licenses/lgpl.html">GNU Lesser General Public License</a>
instead of this License.
