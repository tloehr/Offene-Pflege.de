/**
 * This class makes it easy to drag and drop files from the operating
 * system to a Java program. Any <tt>java.awt.Component</tt> can be
 * dropped onto, but only <tt>javax.swing.JComponent</tt>s will indicate
 * the drop event with a changed border.
 * <p/>
 * To use this class, construct a new <tt>FileDrop</tt> by passing
 * it the target component and a <tt>Listener</tt> to receive notification
 * when file(s) have been dropped. Here is an example:
 * <p/>
 * <code><pre>
 *      JPanel myPanel = new JPanel();
 *      new FileDrop( myPanel, new FileDrop.Listener()
 *      {   public void filesDropped( java.io.File[] files )
 *          {
 *              // handle file drop
 *              ...
 *          }   // end filesDropped
 *      }); // end FileDrop.Listener
 * </pre></code>
 * <p/>
 * You can specify the border that will appear when files are being dragged by
 * calling the constructor with a <tt>javax.swing.border.Border</tt>. Only
 * <tt>JComponent</tt>s will show any indication with a border.
 * <p/>
 * You can turn on some debugging features by passing a <tt>PrintStream</tt>
 * object (such as <tt>System.out</tt>) into the full constructor. A <tt>null</tt>
 * value will result in no extra debugging information being output.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * <p>I'm releasing this code into the Public Domain. Enjoy.
